# Consuming API #

### Shaun Bebbington, 2021 ###

*Aims and objectives:* The aim of this project is to fetch and manipulate JSON data from a fictional
_Supermetrics_ Social Network REST API.

*Technologies used:* I will be broadly using PHP 7. All of the functionality is taken from my own
libraries, or developed with bespoke PHP from the ground up.

*Notes and sundries:* To be added here
